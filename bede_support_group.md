## Definition 
The Bede Support Group (BSG) is a subgroup of the N8 CIR PWG and is led by the RIE Theme Lead, RSE Theme Lead and the head of the on-site platforms group.
The group supports Bede users in getting access and porting their codes to Bede, as well as other Bede-related queries.

## Membership
The Bede Support group consists of research software engineers (RSEs), research infrastructure engineers (RIEs) and system administrators 
from across the N8 Research Partnership. 

The group is also supported by partners from IBM and OCF, ensuring Bede is utilised in the most effective way possible.

## Meeting frequency

## Communications
The BSG communicate via a Slack channel and a mailing list. 

Bede users can contact their local BSG members either per the RT ticketing system, or another specific email address, depending on their institution.

Additionally, BSG members are present at the regular meetings of the [Bede User Group](https://n8cir.org.uk/supporting-research/facilities/bede/bug-tor/).

## Aims 
The group works together to answer technical queries relating to Bede and support Bede users in all software-related queries 
with respect to porting their code to Bede, running it there and using the features of the platform effectively and efficiently. 
They also organise training sessions, write, maintain and extend documentation, and form taks forces to tackle issues brought up by the users.
